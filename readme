ActsAsSlideshow
===============

This plugin lets you easily embed the Flex Slideshow component into your rails application.
All that is required to be done is to install it in the vendor/plugins directory and user and
photo models in place. Also this plugin could be used as a reference for creating rails plugins.

Usage:

Plugin provides a helper method 'embed_slideshow_tag' which lets you embed the Flex component
directly into your views. By default, the helper method would embed the supplied Flex_slideshow
component. As an addition, an argument could be passed to the method for using any other flex
file.

On the controller level, one needs to render user photo data using 'get_photo_data_xml' method
provided by the plugin. 

The Flex component uses a config xml file for setting the URI which is used for getting the user
photo information in xml format. Example shown below would have the URI in config file set as
http://localhost:3000/gallery/show_xml

Plugin provides rake tasks for copying the default Flex slideshow and config files to the public/flash 
directory.


Example
=======

Run from Rails application root directory:
1) rake slideshow:copy_flash_file
2) rake slideshow:copy_config_file

Both of the rake tasks could be run using the following task:
1) rake slideshow:copy_both

Using the ruby/script generator, user photos migration (if not already present) can be 
generated and executed.
1) ruby script/generate acts_as_slideshow_migration
2) rake db:migrate

View: (app/views/gallery/show_slideshow.html.erb)

<%= embed_slideshow_tag %>

Controller: (app/controllers/gallery/show_xml)

def show_xml
  user = User.find(session[:current_user])
  render :xml => user.get_photo_data_xml
end

Config.xml

<root>
  <config>
    <flex-app-title>Smartsourcing Global Flex SlideShow</flex-app-title>
    <DataUrl><![CDATA[http://localhost:3000/gallery/show_xml]]></DataUrl>
    <thumb-width>100</thumb-width>
    <thumb-height>120</thumb-height>
  </config>
</root>
